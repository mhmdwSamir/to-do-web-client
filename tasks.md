1- todo-form input validations:
 * prevent user to add tasks with whitespace
	ex: '      ', then show message says 'please enter a valid text'.

 * prevent user to add tasks with number/special charachters only
	ex: '35^$%$#^%2453456456', then show message says 'enter a valid text'

 * show message if user click on `AddTask` button while input is empty.
  message: 'Please enter todo text to add please'.

2- Make tabs running as expected
 * All tabs retrieve all (completed/todo) tasks
 * Active tab retrieve only todo tasks.
 * Completed tab retrieve only completed tasks.

3- Make `Cleare completed` button work as expected (deletes all completed tasks from the database)
